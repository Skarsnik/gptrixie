I have nearly no background in compilers. So GPTrixie code is probably not that great.
I recomand to have a look at the xml file generated by gccxml.

GPTrixie work like that :

The do magic sub in gptrixie script launch gccxml and parse the xml produced
  At this point, everything is extracted, structures info, types....
  A second pass is done on types/struct/unions to finish solving type.

A 'global' object with everything is created and passed to the generator

The (DG for now) generator take this and generate perl6 string.

A final step is made to try to order correctly the generated output for stuff
like structure (it should be moved to generator?)


CTypes:

CType are defined in the Class.pm6 file. There are Indirect and Direct base type
Indirect are for stuff like pointer type. A type-eq operator was planned
to easily compared them (like $t type-eq <Ptr void>) but it made moar sigseg x)
